      <h1>üë®üèª‚Äçüíª About <span id="about" class="anchor"></span></h1>

      <p> I have obtained my MSc in Computer Science at the Universit√© C√¥te d'Azur in Sophia-Antipolis near Nice
        (France). My 5 years of higher education focused on software development and architecture as well as IT project
        management.<br>
        <br>
        More particularly, through my professional experience into the industry, I've developed expertise in backend
        layers of projects.
        I'm also enthusiast with the blockchain technology has to offer and have developed skills in developing Web3
        applications and smart contracts, which was the subject of my final year thesis. I'm keen to the clean code
        aspect and agile and eXtreme programming methodologies.<br>
        <br>
        Alongside my work, I often do sports such as tennis, weight training and running.
        I enjoy watching my favourite team's football matches and Formula 1 Grand Prix races.
        Finally my favourite pastime remains Texas Hold'em Poker tournaments.

      <h1>üéì Education <span id="education" class="anchor"></span></h1>

      <p>
        The "Innovation and Digital Transformation of the Business" pathway of my MIAGE Master's degree gave me
        knowledge of emerging digital technologies and the identification of innovations that can bring real added value
        to businesses,
        like emerging web frameworks, IoT, AI, cognitive APIs and cloud computing. <br>
        <br>
        This education has also taught me to master project management methodologies and adapt them to the specific
        characteristics of a company and a project (DevOps, Kanban, Storymapping...)
      <ul>
        <li>Technological innovation: data visualisation, learning, collective intelligence, distributed data...</li>
        <li>Innovative software design: collaborative design, agility...</li>
        <li>Business innovation development: entrepreneurship, business strategy...</li>
      </ul>
      Work-study course in an tech company.<br>
